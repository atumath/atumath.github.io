My lecturing and research are on topics in computation and mathematics.
Previously, I held academic posts at IT Sligo, NUI Galway, and University College Dublin. I also worked at the Aon Centre for Innovation and Analytics, and IBM Research in Zurich.
I completed my PhD in Mathematics at NUI Galway in 2009 under an IRCSET Embark Scholarship. In 2014, I was a Fulbright TechImpact Scholar at Stanford University.</description></item></channel></rss>
